# Java Console Task Manager

A simple console-based Task Manager application built using **Core Java**.  
This project demonstrates object-oriented programming, file handling, and basic data persistence without using any external frameworks.

---

## 📌 About the Project
The Java Console Task Manager allows users to manage daily tasks through a command-line interface.  
Users can add tasks, view them, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks.  
All tasks are stored locally using Java object serialization, so data is preserved even after restarting the application.

This project was built to strengthen understanding of **Core Java fundamentals** and backend logic.
